## Overview
Our client NextStop tasked us to make back-end that can handle finding and booking flights, hotels, and experiences for any location across the world. Express and Node was used to develop the severs. Amadeus API was used to retrieve information about flights, hotels, experiences. Fixer.io API was used to adjust currency for to the clients perferred currency. Unsplash API was used to filled photos. OAuthenticate was used to log in and log out clients. Microservices were deployed using Amazon EC2 instance. Docker was used for easy deployment. Supertest was used to test the flights API to ensure consistancy. PostGres was used to hold location and global information. This was a very fun project. We enjoyed working with our client NextStop to develop a one stop shop for young travelers.
